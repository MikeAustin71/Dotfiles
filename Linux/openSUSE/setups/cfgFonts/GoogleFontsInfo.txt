#To install the **Source Code Pro** font on an openSUSE Linux system, you have a few options. Let's go with a simple bash script that downloads and installs the font. However, keep in mind that it's generally recommended to install user fonts in your home directory (`~/.fonts`) rather than system-wide. Here's the script:



# Create a temporary directory
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)

# Download the Source Code Pro font archive
wget -P "$temp_dir" "https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Source%20Code%20Pro"

# Extract the font files
unzip "$temp_dir/Source Code Pro.zip" -d "$temp_dir"

# Install the font system-wide (you can change this to ~/.fonts if you prefer user-level installation)
sudo cp "$temp_dir"/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/

# Update the font cache
sudo fc-cache -f -v

# Clean up temporary files
rm -rf "$temp_dir"

echo "Source Code Pro font has been installed!"
```

Save this script to a file (e.g., `install_source_code_pro.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x install_source_code_pro.sh`), and then run it with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo ./install_source_code_pro.sh
```

Remember to adjust the installation location (`/usr/share/fonts/truetype/` or `~/.fonts`) based on your preference. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance! ðŸš€Â¹Â³
